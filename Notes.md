# ADC sampling
- Doing nothing else, we can get a max sampling rate of ~70kHz

# Not Charging Checklist
- Is the Capybara configured in PS Mode? that's a resistor on the output booster
- Is the cap connected directly (i.e. not through a beefy voltage divider) to
  anything? We've seen op-amps and adc-pins drain the cap
